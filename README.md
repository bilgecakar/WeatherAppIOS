# WeathernoW App

I developed Weather App in order to learn URLSession, RESTful API and animations well. I used [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/) API all of my weather needs. I accessed current weather data  and 3 day / daily forecasts for any location including over 376,000 cities. I used [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android), [ViewAnimator](https://github.com/marcosgriselli/ViewAnimator) packages and Core Animations to make animations also used URLSession for network data transfer tasks. 

When app starts, you can see city name, current temperature, sunrise, wind speed, rate of cloud, datetime (the city's own timezone) and weather forecast for 3 day. You can check the weather forecast of the city you want.

City CSV file:
